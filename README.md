# WooCommerce-Checkout-Notification
I am forking this to make some changes to how it works:

1. To add the notification to the checkout page (currently it is in the cart page)
2. Additonally (later) to look at adding it to Cart OR Checkout OR Both.

Props to original dev. I am changing very little on this!
